Explanation of the Singleton Logger Code (Step-by-Step)

---

Concept: Singleton Pattern

1. Purpose: Ensures that only one instance of a class exists throughout the application.
2. Use Case: Ideal for shared resources like logging, configuration managers, or database connections.

Logger Class

1.Private Static Instance:

      private static Logger singleInstance;
  
    ->Holds the single object of the Logger class.

2. Private Constructor:

   java
   private Logger() { ... }
   
   -> Prevents other classes from creating a new `Logger` object directly.

3. Public Static Method:

   
   public static Logger getInstance() { ... }
   

   ->Returns the single instance.
   Creates it only if it doesn't already exist (lazy initialization).

4. Logging Method:

   public void log(String message) { ... }
  

   ->Simply prints a log message to the console.


 Demo Class (Main Method)

1. Get Singleton Instance:

    Logger logger = Logger.getInstance();
  

   Retrieves the single instance of Logger.

2. User Input:

   Uses Scanner to take two log messages from the user.

3. Log the Messages:

   logger.log(msg1);
   logger.log(msg2);
  

   Calls the log method to print user messages.

4. Verify Singleton:

   if (logger == logger2)
   

   Compares two logger references.
   Confirms that both refer to the same object (Singleton is working).


Why Use Singleton for Logger?

* Prevents creation of multiple loggers.
* Centralizes logging behavior across all classes.
* Saves memory and ensures consistency in output.
